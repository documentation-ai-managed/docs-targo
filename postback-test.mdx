### **1.&#x20;**&#x4C;ogin to your account

Open the **Apps** section, select your app, and click on the **Postback** tab. Scroll down to the **Postback Tester** area.

### **2. Fill in the Test Data**

Enter the following details to simulate a conversion:

- **User ID:** Enter a unique test ID (e.g., `user123`).

- **Payout:** Enter a test amount (e.g., `5.00`).

- **Offer Name:** Enter the name of the offer (e.g., `test_offer`).

- **Conversion Status:** Select **OK**, **Reversed**, or **Pending**.

> **Note:** Technical data such as **Event ID**, **IP Address**, and **Country...** will be **generated automatically** by the system to simulate a real user environment.

### **3. Send the Postback**

Click the **Send Postback** button to initiate the test.

### **4. Verify the Result**

Observe the status message that appears after clicking the button:

- **Success:** If you see **"Test postback sent successfully!"**, your postback is working correctly and you are ready to go live.

- **Failed:** If the test fails, look at the **Response Body** provided in the logs. It will show the specific error returned by your server (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error, or Auth Failure) so you can fix it.
