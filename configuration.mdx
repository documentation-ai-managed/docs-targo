title: Postback Configuration (S2S)
description: >-
  Server-to-Server (Postback) callbacks allow your system to receive reward
  notifications directly from the offerwall via HTTP requests.

  When a user successfully completes an offer and earns a reward, TarGo sends an
  HTTP GET request to your configured postback URL

<Callout kind="info" collapsed="false">
  *We automatically add &#x20;*`&hash={hash}`

  *to all postback URLs. If you want to verify the request and ensure security, please validate the&#x20;****hash&#x20;****parameter.*

### **Response**

Our system considers a postback successfully processed only if your server responds with **HTTP status code 200** and the **response body contains either&#x20;**`1`**&#x20;or&#x20;**`OK`.

Any other response will be treated as a failed postback. If a postback fails, our system will automatically retry sending it **once every 6 hours**, up to a maximum of **5 retries** per postback.

After 5 failed attempts, the system will stop retrying, and you must **contact your account manager** to resend all failed postbacks manually.
