title: Postback Configuration (S2S)
description: >-
  Server-to-Server (Postback) callbacks allow your system to receive reward
  notifications directly from the offerwall via HTTP requests.

  When a user successfully completes an offer and earns a reward, TarGo sends an
  HTTP POST request to your configured postback URL
